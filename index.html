            <p>My passion is to create great changes to improve the world.  I chose to get my bachelor's degree in nursing and then go to medical school to become a Cardiologist.  As I was going to school I started working at a hospital and through my four years of experience there I didn't see myself fitting into a doctor's role.  Although I was half way through nursing school and all my prerequsites for medical school were completed, I decided to change careers to IT and I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Networking and Cybersecurity with a 4.0 GPA.  I got a job at Amazon Web Services and there I was introduced to programming.  I saw programming as a great way to achieve my goal since technology is where the world is heading towards today.</p>

                <p>I've crafted a user-friendly website that allows individuals to submit their wills securely, ensuring their loved ones can access them when needed. Using my full-stack development skills, I designed an intuitive interface with a unique <b>DEMO</b> on the login page that showcases the site's features without requiring login details. The platform includes will submission, encrypted document storage, and easy retrieval, all while maintaining security standards</p>
